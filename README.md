# Bedun (ᠪᡝᡩᡠᠨ)

## Introduction

The Manchu language (ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡤᡳᠰᡠᠨ) is a critically endangered Tungusic language native to Northeast China and traditionally spoken by the Manchu ethnic group. According to the [Endangered Languages Project](https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1205?hl=en), there's less than 20 estimated native speakers of the language still alive. However, with a virtual treasure trove of sources from the Qing Dynasty that have yet to be translated, to lose the Manchu language would be a travesty. Bedun is my attempt to contribute to the preservation effort. Bedun means "sturdy" or "solidly made" in Manchu, and it's my hope that this web application can be a reliable tool for aspiring Manjurists like the name suggests.


## Features


### Multifaceted Word Search

With Bedun, you have the power to explore Manchu vocabulary using three distinct approaches:

- **Manchu Script**: Input a word in the Manchu script, and Bedun will promptly display its meaning and Romanization.
- **Romanized Manchu**: Enter the Romanized version of a word, and Bedun will provide you with its corresponding Manchu script and English translation.
- **English**: Search for Manchu words by inputting their English translations.


### Seamless Integration with Buleku

As a Manchu language enthusiast, you may already be familiar with [Buleku](https://buleku.org/home), an exceptional dictionary app created by the dedicated team at [Manc.hu](https://manc.hu/en). However, you might have noticed that Buleku only utilizes Romanized Manchu. While this choice is practical from a logistical perspective, the Manchu script is beautiful and one of the main appeals of learning the language.


### Vertical Manchu Script Display

Unlock a unique feature of Bedun: the ability to view Manchu script vertically. Click the "Make Larger" button to experience the Manchu script as it should be written, enhancing your grasp of this elegant writing system. Please note that this feature is not supported in Safari due to CSS constraints. For optimal results, I recommend using Firefox.

### Customizable Font Selection

Tailor your Manchu learning experience with the font selection feature in the settings panel. Thanks to Panlex, a valuable resource for Manchu enthusiasts, you can choose your preferred font style. For more information, please see the following article on the [Manchu Studies Group](https://www.manchustudiesgroup.org/typing-manchu/) website.
